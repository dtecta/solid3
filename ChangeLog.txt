ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.8 24/04/2015
		  	  		  * Added CMake configuration
                      * Fixed compilation and warnings fro gcc 4.8.3 (Thanks Sven Köhler)

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.7 18/06/2013
                      * Fixed crash on calling DT_GetPenDepth, DT_GetClosestPiar, 
					    and DT_GetCommonPoint with first object a convex and second
						object a complex. Thanks Robin Tomcin.

                      * Fixed segmentation fault in qhull under gcc 4.1.x - 4.3.x. 
					    Thanks Florian Kamm for the build fix.                  

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.6 06/05/2007
                      * Fixed bug in creation of Dobkin-Kirkpatrick hierarchy. Thanks Markus Rickert.

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.5 02/10/2006
                      * Fixed build for g++ 4.1.

                      * Fixed automake files for building from configuration
                        directories other than the top dir.

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.4 29/08/2005
                      * Fixed consistency problem with Euler angles.

                      * Changed DT_Index and DT_Count from unsigned short
                        to unsigned int. This will allow complexes to
                        be created that have more than 65536
                        triangles. The maximum now is 4 billion. Note 
                        that this change increases the memory
                        footprint of complex shapes, so if memory is
                        an issue you might want to change it back.

                      * Fixed refitting of complex shapes. Bounding
                        boxes of complex shapes were not updated after
                        refitting unless the object also received an
                        updated placement.

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.3 09/02/2005
                      * Changed a rounding-dependent assertion into an early 
					    out in penetration_depth.
					
					  * Fixed hybrid_penetration_depth call in
                        DT_Complex.cpp. Thanks Speedy! 

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.2 17/08/2004

                      * Fixed source for compilation under gcc 3.4. 
                        Thanks Kester Maddock and Tobias Kieslich
                        for suggesting fixes. 

DT_Complex.cpp        * Fixed memory leak                     

DT_GJK.h              * Vertix-in-simplex check now uses a tolerance
                        for improved robustness. 

DT_PenDepth.cpp       * Major reimplementation of polytope data structure in
                        the Expanding Polytope Algorithm for better
                        robustness and performance. Thanks Piere
                        Terdiman of Novodex for bringing this issue to
                        my attention. 

DT_Scene.h            * Added a "testing" flag to signal objects being
                        moved while testing. 


 

ChangeLog for SOLID 3.5.1 28/12/2003

BP_ProxyList.h:       * Wrong use of STL std::vector<>(size_t n)
                        constructor. Should reserve rather than add.  
DT_GJK.h:             * Unrolled loops in DT_GJK::compute_det() for
                        better performance.
DT_PenDepth.cpp:      * Reduced max number of iterations by an order of
                        magnitude.
MT_ScalarTracer.h:    * This file was missing in the CDROM distribution.
configure.ac:         * Disabled the DEBUG flag for debug builds.
                      * Optimization bug in gcc 3.3.1 causes a SEGV in
                        addFacet. Fixed by setting '-O2 -fno-gcse' flags.
